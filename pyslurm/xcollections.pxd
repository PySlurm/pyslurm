    """Mapping of Multi-Cluster Data for a Collection.

    !!! note "TL;DR"

        If you have no need to write Multi-Cluster capable code and just work
        on a single Cluster, Collections inheriting from this Class behave
        just like a normal `dict`.

    This class enables collections to hold data from multiple Clusters if
    applicable.
    For quite a few Entities in Slurm it is possible to gather data from
    multiple Clusters. For example, with `sacct`, you can easily query Jobs
    running on different Clusters - provided your Cluster is joined in a
    Federation or simply part of a multi Cluster Setup.

    Collections like [pyslurm.db.Jobs][] inherit from this Class to enable
    holding such data from multiple Clusters. Internally, the data is
    structured in a `dict` like this (with [pyslurm.db.Jobs][] as an example):

    ```python
    data = {
        "LOCAL_CLUSTER": {
            1: pyslurm.db.Job(1),
            2: pyslurm.db.Job(2),
            ...
        },
        "OTHER_REMOTE_CLUSTER": {
            100: pyslurm.db.Job(100),
            101, pyslurm.db.Job(101)
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

    When a collection inherits from this class, its functionality will
    basically simulate a standard `dict` - with a few extensions to enable
    multi-cluster code.
    By default, even if your Collections contains Data from multiple Clusters,
    any operation will be targeted on the local Cluster data, if available.

    For example, with the data from above:

    ```python
    job = data[1]
    ```

    `job` would then hold the instance for `pyslurm.db.Job(1)` from the
    `LOCAL_CLUSTER` data.

    Alternatively, data can also be accessed like this:

    ```python
    job = data["OTHER_REMOTE_CLUSTER"][100]
    ```

    Here, you are directly specifying which Cluster data you want to access,
    and you will get the instance for `pyslurm.db.Job(100)` from the
    `OTHER_REMOTE_CLUSTER` data.

    Similarly, every method (where applicable) from a standard dict is
    extended with multi-cluster functionality (check out the examples on the
    methods)
