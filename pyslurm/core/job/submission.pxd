            out the sbatch documentation for --cpu-freq.

            If you only want to set a Governor without any min or max, you
            can simply specify it as a standalone string:

                cpu_frequency = "Performance"
                or
                cpu_frequency = {"governor": "Performance"}

                    "min": 3,
                    "max": 6
                }

            When no range is needed, you can also simply specify it as int:

                nodes = 3

            Other than that, a range can also be specified in a str like with
            sbatch:

            This is the same as --switches from sbatch.

            
            For example, specifying it as a dict:

                switches = { "count": 5, "max_wait_time": "00:10:00" }

            Or as a single string (sbatch-style):

                switches = "5@00:10:00"
        signal (Union[dict, str]):
            Warn signal to be sent to the Job.

            This is the same as --signal from sbatch.
            The signal can both be specified with its name, e.g. "SIGKILL", or
            as a number, e.g. 9


            For example, specifying it as a dict:

                signal = {
                    "signal": "SIGKILL",
                    "time": 120
                }

            The above will send a "SIGKILL" signal 120 seconds before the
            Jobs' time limit is reached.

            Or, specifying it as a string (sbatch-style):

                signal = "SIGKILL@120"
        standard_in (str):
            Path to a File acting as standard_in for the batch-script.
            This is the same as -i/--input from sbatch.
        standard_error (str):
            Path to a File acting as standard_error for the batch-script.
            This is the same as -e/--error from sbatch.
        standard_output (str):
            Path to a File to write the Jobs standard_output.
            This is the same as -o/--output from sbatch.
        kill_on_invalid_dependency (bool):
            Kill the job if it has an invalid dependency.
            This is the same as --kill-on-invalid-dep from sbatch.
        spreads_over_nodes (bool):
            Spread the Job over as many nodes as possible.
            This is the same as --spread-job from sbatch.
        use_min_nodes (bool):
            Prefer the minimum amount of nodes specified.
            This is the same as --use-min-nodes from sbatch.
        gres_binding (str):
            Generic resource task binding options.
            This is the --gres-flags option from sbatch.


            Possible values are:

            * `enforce-binding`
            * `disable-binding`
        temporary_disk_per_node (Union[str, int]):
            Amount of temporary disk space needed per node.

            This is the same as --tmp from sbatch. You can specify units like
            K|M|G|T (multiples of 1024).
            If no unit is specified, the value will be assumed as Mebibytes.


            Examples:

                # 2048 MiB
                tmp_disk_per_node = "2G"

                # 1024 MiB
                tmp_disk_per_node = 1024
        get_user_environment (Union[str, bool, int]):
            TODO
        min_cpus_per_node (str):
            Set the minimum amount of CPUs required per Node.
            This is the same as --mincpus from sbatch.
        wait_all_nodes (bool):
            Controls when the execution of the command begins.

            A value of True means that the Job should begin execution only
            after all nodes in the allocation are ready. Setting it to False,
            the default, means that it is not waited for the nodes to be
            ready. (i.e booted)
