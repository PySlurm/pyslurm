# pyslurm

The `pyslurm` package is a wrapper around the Slurm C-API


!!! warning
    Please note that the `pyslurm` API is currently being completely reworked.
    Reworked classes and functions that replace functionality of the old API
    will be marked as such, with a link to the documentation of its old
    counterpart.

    Old API functionality that is already replaced is marked as deprecated,
    and will be removed at some point in the future.

    If you are using the new-style API, we would like to know your feedback on
    it!
