pyslurm is the Python client library for the [Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com)

## Requirements

* [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) - Slurm shared library and header files
* [Python](https://www.python.org) - >= 3.6
* [Cython](https://cython.org) - >= 0.29.30 but < 3.0

This Version is for Slurm 23.02.x

## Versioning

In pyslurm, the versioning scheme follows the official Slurm versioning. The
first two numbers (`MAJOR.MINOR`) always correspond to Slurms Major-Release,
for example `23.02`.
The last number (`MICRO`) is however not tied in any way to Slurms `MICRO`
version, but is instead PySlurm's internal Patch-Level. For example, any
pyslurm 23.02.X version should work with any Slurm 23.02.X release.

## Installation

By default, it is searched inside `/usr/include` for the Header files and in
`/usr/lib64` for Slurms shared-library (`libslurm.so`) during Installation.
For Slurm installations in different locations, you will need to provide
the corresponding paths to the necessary files.

You can specify those with environment variables (recommended), for example:

```shell
export SLURM_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/slurm/23.02/include
export SLURM_LIB_DIR=/opt/slurm/23.02/lib
```

Then you can proceed to install pyslurm, for example by cloning the Repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PySlurm/pyslurm.git && cd pyslurm
scripts/build.sh

# Or simply with pip
pip install .
```
